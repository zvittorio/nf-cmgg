// Flatten transforms the channel in such a way that every tuple is
// flattened, creating a queue channel where each tuple item becomes a
// single channel item

foo = [1, 2, 3]

Channel
    .of(foo, bar)
    .flatten() // with this you pass all values individually (again, with no order)
    .view()
